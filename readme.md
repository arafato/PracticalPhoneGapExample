Practical PhoneGap: Example Project
=============

This project is a small, fairly useless PhoneGap application. It provides a test bed for 
showing how to use HTML/JS/CSS to build apps using PhoneGap for:

* iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod)
* Android
* Windows Phone 7/8
* Winodws 8 (Modern App...Metro App...or whatever the name is today)
* Even Blackberry...stop laughing...it really does work
